The album title is derived from Ephesians 5:19, which says: "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord." Mcclurkin explains that he wanted to create an album that would reflect the diversity of worship expressions in the church. He says: "There are so many different ways to praise God. There are psalms that are poetic and prophetic. There are hymns that are doctrinal and theological. And there are spiritual songs that are spontaneous and personal. I wanted to capture all of that on this album."
  
The album starts with a rousing rendition of "Days of Elijah", a popular song that declares the coming of the Lord. Mcclurkin then leads the audience into a medley of "I Will Sing" and "I Call You Faithful", two songs that affirm God's goodness and faithfulness. The next track, "Great and Mighty Is Our God", is a majestic anthem that exalts God's greatness and sovereignty. The album then shifts to a more intimate tone with "Only You Are Holy" and "Agnus Dei", two songs that express reverence and awe for God's holiness.
  
One of the highlights of the album is the "Blood Medley", which consists of three parts. The first part is a stirring rendition of "At the Cross", a classic hymn that celebrates the power of the blood of Jesus. The second part is a sermon by Mcclurkin, who preaches about the importance of the blood in salvation, healing, and deliverance. The third part is a spontaneous song by Mcclurkin, who sings about the blood with passion and emotion.
  
The album also features some guest appearances by other gospel artists. Dottie Peoples joins Mcclurkin on "I Love to Praise Him", a lively song that invites everyone to praise God with joy. JoAnn Rosario sings with Mcclurkin on "Saciame SeÃ±or/Yo Se Que EstÃ¡s AquÃ­", a bilingual song that expresses hunger and thirst for God's presence. Richard Smallwood accompanies Mcclurkin on piano on "Total Praise", a beautiful song that offers praise to God in every situation.
  
The album ends with a bonus track, "We Fall Down", which is one of Mcclurkin's signature songs. The song is a humble confession of sin and a declaration of God's grace. Mcclurkin sings it with sincerity and conviction, as he shares his testimony of how God saved him from a life of drugs, abuse, and depression.
