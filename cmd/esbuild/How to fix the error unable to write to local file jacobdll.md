# How to fix the error "unable to write to local file jacob.dll"
 
If you are using JACOB, a Java-COM Bridge that allows you to call COM Automation components from Java[^2^], you may encounter the error "unable to write to local file jacob.dll" when trying to run your application. This error means that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) cannot access or write the jacob.dll file, which is a native library that JACOB uses to communicate with COM objects.

There are several possible causes and solutions for this error, depending on your environment and configuration. Here are some common ones:
 
- **Check the permissions of the jacob.dll file and its folder.** Make sure that the JVM has read and write access to the file and its parent folder. You can use the `chmod` command on Linux or Mac OS, or the `icacls` command on Windows, to change the permissions. For example, on Windows, you can run `icacls jacob.dll /grant Everyone:(F)` to grant full control to everyone for the jacob.dll file.
- **Check the location of the jacob.dll file.** Make sure that the file is in a folder that is on the JVM's library path. You can use the `-Djava.library.path` option when launching your application to specify the library path. For example, if your jacob.dll file is in C:\jacob\lib, you can run `java -Djava.library.path=C:\jacob\lib -jar yourapp.jar` to launch your application.
- **Check the version of the jacob.dll file.** Make sure that the file matches the version of JACOB that you are using, and that it is compatible with your JVM's architecture. For example, if you are using JACOB 1.20 and a 64-bit JVM, you need to use the jacob-1.20-x64.dll file. You can download different versions of JACOB from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/[^2^].
- **Use an applet instead of a standalone application.** If you are deploying your application as an applet, you can avoid the error by providing the jacob.dll file as part of your applet, so that there is no local installation necessary. JACOB itself provides a nice applet example for that: Download the JACOB source from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/[^2^] and have a look at the applet example: jacob-1.XX\samples\com\jacob\samples\applet[^1^].

In this section, we will provide some additional information and tips about using JACOB and COM Automation components in Java.
 
## What are COM Automation components?
 
COM stands for Component Object Model, which is a technology that allows software components to communicate with each other across different languages and platforms. COM Automation is a subset of COM that enables scripting languages and applications to control and automate other applications that expose their functionality as COM objects. For example, you can use COM Automation to create a Word document, insert some text and images, save it as a PDF file, and send it as an email attachment, all from a single script or application.
 
## Why use JACOB?
 
JACOB is a Java-COM Bridge that allows you to call COM Automation components from Java. It uses JNI (Java Native Interface) to make native calls to the COM libraries. JACOB has several advantages over other Java-COM bridges, such as:

- **It is open source and free.** You can download, modify, and distribute JACOB under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
- **It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit JVMs.** You can use JACOB on any platform that supports Java and COM, such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS.
- **It has a simple and intuitive API.** You can use JACOB to access any COM object or method with minimal code. JACOB also provides some helper classes and methods to make common tasks easier, such as creating variants, dispatching events, or converting data types.
- **It has a large and active community.** You can find many examples, tutorials, documentation, and support for JACOB on the internet. You can also contribute to the project by reporting bugs, requesting features, or submitting patches.

## How to use JACOB?
 
To use JACOB in your Java application, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Add the JACOB jar file to your classpath.** You can download the latest version of JACOB from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/. The jar file contains the Java classes and interfaces that you need to use JACOB. You can add the jar file to your classpath by using the `-cp` option when launching your application, or by adding it to your IDE's build path.
2. **Add the jacob.dll file to your library path.** You also need to download the jacob.dll file that matches your JVM's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/. The dll file contains the native code that JACOB uses to communicate with COM objects. You need to add the dll file to your library path by using the `-Djava.library.path` option when launching your application, or by copying it to a folder that is on the default library path (such as C:\Windows\System32).
3. **Create and use COM objects in your Java code.** Once you have added the jar and dll files to your paths, you can start using JACOB in your Java code. You can create COM objects by using the `ActiveXComponent` class or the `ComThread` class. You can access their properties and methods by using the `Dispatch` class or the `Variants` class. You can also register and handle events by using the `EventCookie` class or the `_XXXEvents` interfaces. For more details and examples on how to use JACOB, you can refer to the official documentation at https://sourceforge.net/p/jacob-project/wiki/Home/ or the sample code at jacob-1.XX\samples\com\jacob\samples.
